# Data Management: JDBC, Transactions, SpringData JPA

## ‚ùì Question1: What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions? Why does Spring prefer unchecked exceptions? What is the data access exception hierarchy?

Checked exception ‚Äì Exception that is extending java.lang.Exception \(expect java.lang.RuntimeException\) class that has to be explicitly declared in throws part of method signature of the method that is throwing an exception and has to be explicitly handled by code that invokes the method. If code that is calling the method with checked exception does not handle the exception, it has to declare it in throws part of the method signature.

      <td style="text-align:left">Coupling between callee and caller</td>

Unchecked exception ‚Äì Exception that is extending java.lang.RuntimeException class, does not have to be explicitly declared in throws part of method signature of method that is throwing an exception and does not have to be explicitly handled by code that invokes the method. The developer has freedom of choice if error handling should be implemented or not.

üéØ Data Access Exception is a Runtime Exception

üéØ Examples of concrete Data Access Exceptions

* CannotAcquireLockException
* CannotCreateRecordException
* DataIntegrityViolationException

üéØThe purpose of this hierarchy is to create an abstraction layer on top of Data Access APIs to avoid coupling with the concrete implementation of Data Access APIs
